# Git-For-Idiots (solo)

Many people are overwhelmed by Git's complexity. I am not here to judge that.

However, having online backups and version control is still a major nice-to-have, especially when working with CLI AI agents like Claude Code or conducting "vibe coding".

That's why this repository breaks down the whole Git functionality to **four basic commands** which allow full Git use including rollbacks and version management.

Please be aware that this is **for solo projects only** on macOS, and please also be aware that **every experienced coder will disrespect you for using this**. 
However, I still love to make things as simple as they can be, and this repository achieves exactly that.
